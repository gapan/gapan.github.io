This repository hosts the files for my personal website hosted at
[vlahavas.com](https://vlahavas.com).

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The `master` branch
includes the generated html files that actually show up in the website,
while the `source` branch includes the Markdown source files that Hugo
parses.
