      <description>The ESP8266 ESP-01 board is a tiny little board with a microcontroller that also includes a wifi network interface. It is also very cheap, you can find one online for about 1â‚¬. If you have a project that needs wifi connectivity, but not too many pins, it&amp;rsquo;s perfect.
Here is the pinout of the board:
You should be careful that it needs a 3.3V power source to operate. Powering it with 5V will probably fry it.</description>

      <description>It turns out that my baby daughter is absolutely mesmerized by xscreensaver and by the many awesome screensavers it includes. Her favourite so far seems to be Pacman! Here it is in all its glory:
So I needed to find a way to manually launch it fullscreen. I could do it by launching xscreensaver-demo from the menu or a terminal, then choosing the screensaver from the list and hitting the Preview button.</description>

      <description>My sister has an HP laptop that she bought a few years ago. The exact model is the HP 14-r27n. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a powerhouse when she bought it and it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t now, but having installed Salix, in place of the Windows 8 that came with it, and which were almost never booted, it still gets the job done.
So, she called me a few days ago and told me that something was wrong with it; certain apps wouldn&amp;rsquo;t launch.</description>

      <description>I have fortune enabled on most of my systems, so whenever I log in, I get a quotation. Today, I got this one. Suffice to say, I found it really funny!
 A is for awk, which runs like a snail, and
B is for biff, which reads all your mail.
C is for cc, as hackers recall, while
D is for dd, the command that does all.
E is for emacs, which rebinds your keys, and</description>

      <title>Using Hugo with Github Pages</title>

      <description>So, I decided to start using Hugo as the platform for my website/blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into different options, including Jekyll and Hexo and in the end, Hugo is the one that made the most sense to me.
I also wanted to use Github Pages with it, including using a custom domain and using HTTPS by default. Had I chosen Jekyll, integration with Github Pages would have been automatic. However, Github Pages do not directly support any other static website generator.</description>
