    <p>I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29">fortune</a>
enabled on most of my systems, so whenever I log in, I get a quotation.
Today, I got this one. Suffice to say, I found it really funny!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A is for awk, which runs like a snail, and</p>

<p>B is for biff, which reads all your mail.</p>

<p>C is for cc, as hackers recall, while</p>

<p>D is for dd, the command that does all.</p>

<p>E is for emacs, which rebinds your keys, and</p>

<p>F is for fsck, which rebuilds your trees.</p>

<p>G is for grep, a clever detective, while</p>

<p>H is for halt, which may seem defective.</p>

<p>I is for indent, which rarely amuses, and</p>

<p>J is for join, which nobody uses.</p>

<p>K is for kill, which makes you the boss, while</p>

<p>L is for lex, which is missing from DOS.</p>

<p>M is for more, from which less was begot, and</p>

<p>N is for nice, which it really is not.</p>

<p>O is for od, which prints out things nice, while</p>

<p>P is for passwd, which reads in strings twice.</p>

<p>Q is for quota, a Berkeley-type fable, and</p>

<p>R is for ranlib, for sorting ar table.</p>

<p>S is for spell, which attempts to belittle, while</p>

<p>T is for true, which does very little.</p>

<p>U is for uniq, which is used after sort, and</p>

<p>V is for vi, which is hard to abort.</p>

<p>W is for whoami, which tells you your name, while</p>

<p>X is, well, X, of dubious fame.</p>

<p>Y is for yes, which makes an impression, and</p>

<p>Z is for zcat, which handles compression.</p>
