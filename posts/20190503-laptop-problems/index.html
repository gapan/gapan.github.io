      <h2 class="date">May 3, 2019</h2>

      
    </header>

    <p>My sister has an HP laptop that she bought a few years ago. The exact
model is the HP 14-r27n. It wasn&rsquo;t a powerhouse when she bought it and
it certainly isn&rsquo;t now, but having installed <a href="https://salixos.org/">Salix</a>,
in place of the Windows 8 that came with it, and which were almost never
booted, it still gets the job done.</p>

<p>So, she called me a few days ago and told me that something was wrong
with it; certain apps wouldn&rsquo;t launch. I thought it was weird and my
first reaction was to try reinstall them, in case she had removed them
by accident (although I couldn&rsquo;t tell how or why). So, I instructed her
to launch the <a href="https://software.jaos.org/#gslapt">gslapt</a> package
manager from the menu. After she entered he password at the sudo prompt,
she told me that nothing happened. So that was weird too. I told her to
try again, in case she was entering a wrong password or something, but
still nothing. I then instructed her to open a terminal window and
launch gslapt from there. I was thinking that maybe, somehow, she had
removed some library that gslapt and everything else that wouldn&rsquo;t
launch needed. To that she responded with:
<em>&ldquo;It says &lsquo;Input output error&rsquo;&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>That was bad. I knew exactly what that was and I immediately asked her
if she had an external hard drives. She responded that she did, so I
told her to take immediate backups of everything she didn&rsquo;t want to
lose. The spinning hard drive in her laptop, the one that it came with
when she bought it, was starting to fail.</p>

<p>Thankfully, she was able to backup everything in her home directory,
only the OS partition seemed to be affected for now, but I told her
that she should stop working on that laptop, until we could replace
the hard drive. She was going to visit in a few days anyway, so
downtime wouldn&rsquo;t be that long.</p>

<p>When she arrived a few days later, I ran a few tests using
<a href="https://www.smartmontools.org/">smartmontools</a>. These proved that
I had been right in my guess, the hard drive was starting to fail.</p>

<p>I had an SSD drive that I hadn&rsquo;t ever used lying around, so I though I
could use that to replace the failing hard drive. It would also make the
laptop a bit faster.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the laptop didn&rsquo;t have an easily accessible bay to get to
the hard drive. I needed to tear it apart completely, remove every
screw, unplug everything from the motherboard and then be able to access
the hard drive. It took me a bit, but I got there.</p>

<p>By opening it up, I noticed that the laptop didn&rsquo;t have an optical drive
installed (I already knew that), but there was space for one inside. In
place of the optical drive there was a plastic placeholder. But the
SATA connectors for an optical drive were there! I then remembered that
a few years ago I had ordered a 2nd HD caddy from eBay I intended to
use it on an older laptop of mine, in order to install a second hard
drive in place of the failing optical drive that it had, but I never got
to actually doing it. The caddy looks exactly like this one (not my
picture):</p>

<p><img src="https://vlahavas.com/images/hdd-caddy.jpg" alt="HDD caddy" /></p>

<p>So, in addition to the SSD drive, I thought I could also add a second
hard drive for storage. And since I was at it, how about upgrading the
mere 2GB of RAM that it had?</p>

<p>The SODIMM slot was nowhere to be seen though. It turns out, that it is
even more inaccessible than the hard drive. You have to unscrew the
entire motherboard from the case, remove the wifi card and USB
interfaces, and flip it around, as the slot is located at the bottom
side of the motherboard.</p>

<p>Did you notice the singular there? &ldquo;SODIMM slot&rdquo;. Turns out there&rsquo;s only
one. So, my initial thought of using a spare 2GB SODIMM module I had
lying around to double the available RAM disappeared. Oh well&hellip;</p>

<p>I did a quick search online and found out that the laptop supports up to
8GB of RAM, so I went ahead and ordered a module of that size. That
would definitely make a huge difference. I also ordered a spinning hard
drive to install along side the SSD, so there would be plenty of space
for my sister&rsquo;s files.  The SSD was smaller than the original hard drive
anyway and couldn&rsquo;t fit all her files.</p>

<p>A few days later, when my order arrived (it got delayed for a few days
because it was around the Easter holidays), I replaced the old
hard drive with the new one, also installed the 2nd hard drive with the
caddy and replaced the RAM module. I put the laptop back together and
surprisingly, everything worked!</p>

<p>I then proceeded to install Salix 14.2, same version as before. Less
than five minutes later, the installation was complete and I was booting
into the new system.</p>

<p>And that was the first time something went wrong. The system booted, but
only to a blank screen, when it should had been showing the GDM login
screen. Boot messages were visible before that though. And I quickly
found out that by switching virtual terminals with Ctrl-Alt-F1 and back
with Ctl-Alt-F7, GDM would show fine and I could log in.</p>

<p>OK then. So I performed all available upgrades, which also brought in Linux
kernel 4.4.172, in place of the 4.4.157 kernel it had with the old hard
drive. I thought that maybe that would fix the blank screen issue, but
it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>That was weird, because apart from the minor update to the kernel,
everything else was exactly as it was with the old hard drive and
apparently there weren&rsquo;t any problem there.</p>

<p>The graphics card, as reported by <code>lspci</code> is this one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Graphics &amp; Display (rev 0e) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
        Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Graphics &amp; Display
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 92
        Memory at 90000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4M]
        Memory at 80000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]
        I/O ports at 3050 [size=8]
        Expansion ROM at &lt;unassigned&gt; [disabled]
        Capabilities: [d0] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [90] MSI: Enable+ Count=1/1 Maskable- 64bit-
        Capabilities: [b0] Vendor Specific Information: Len=07 &lt;?&gt;
        Kernel driver in use: i915
        Kernel modules: i915</pre></div>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d try upgrading to the latest Xorg intel drivers, so I
pulled the code from git, compiled and made a pretty package and
installed it in place of the stock one. It didn&rsquo;t make a difference.</p>

<p>I quickly found out that booting into <code>init 3</code> and then starting the
graphical environment with <code>startx</code> always worked though.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I started moving my sister&rsquo;s settings files from the
old hard drive to the SSD. A good thing too, because the old hard drive
decided to finally die shortly after that. After I copied all settings
files, logging into my sister&rsquo;s account was fine, but logging into my
(freshly created) account would show a blank screen!</p>

<p>It turns out that the screen wasn&rsquo;t completely blank. Rather the screen
brightness for my account for some reason was set to the lowest possible
setting. Except that it wasn&rsquo;t, it was set to the highest possible
setting, but for some weird reason brightness controls were completely
reversed! The brightness buttons on the laptop would work, but the
&ldquo;Increase brightness&rdquo; button would decrease it and the &ldquo;Decrease
brightness&rdquo; button would increase it! Except it was even weirded than
that, because as the setting would decrease to 10%, at 10% decrements,
brightness would increase, but if I further decreased the setting to
0%, the screen would turn blank! And that was true for both mine and my
sister&rsquo;s accounts. And it wasn&rsquo;t just the hardware buttons, the
behaviour was the same for the software slider in MATE-power-manager.</p>

<p>I had never seen anything like that before, and after a quick web search
I came up with nothing useful. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to deal with this.
After a while I thought I would look up the available options for the
kernel module that is used for the graphics card, i915, with
<code>modinfo -p i915</code>. So, I got this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">modeset:Use kernel modesetting [KMS] (0=disable, 1=on, -1=force vga console preference [default]) (int)

guc_log_level:GuC firmware logging level (-1:disabled (default), 0-3:enabled) (int)</pre></div>
<p>Can you spot it? Here, I&rsquo;ll help you out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">invert_brightness:Invert backlight brightness (-1 force normal, 0 machine defaults, 1 force inversion), please report PCI device ID, subsystem vendor and subsystem device ID to dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org, if your machine needs it. It will then be included in an upcoming module version. (int)</pre></div>
<p>Aha! So, that is, in fact, a thing! I then quickly added a file
<code>/etc/modprobe.d/20-intel.conf</code> with the following one line of contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">options i915 invert_brightness=1</pre></div>
<p>Then, I closed the graphical environment with <code>sudo init 3</code>, unloaded
the kernel module with <code>sudo modprobe -r i915</code> and reloaded it with
<code>sudo modprobe i915</code>. I restarted Xorg and the brightness controls would
work as expected. Nice!</p>

<p>Except that not everything was right. Sometimes, when Xorg would come up,
fonts on the system menu would look weird. Sometimes, some letters would
be completely missing. Others, they would show up somehow distorted.
Moving the mouse cursor over them would make them appear properly,
sometimes.</p>

<p>I remembered that my sister had complained about something like that
before. She had even sent me a picture of when it happened, because I
couldn&rsquo;t understand it when she was describing it to me. It would happen
very seldomly with the old hard drive, maybe once a month or so. And a
restart would always fix it. But with the new one, the problems appeared
almost half the times Xorg was started.</p>

<p>I played around with some other i915 kernel module options, but nothing
seemed to fix it. I then decided that I could try changing a few Xorg
options. And after trying out a few, I came to a solution. By adding a
file <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf</code> with the following contents,
made everything work with no issues:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">Section &#34;Device&#34;
  Identifier &#34;Intel Graphics&#34;
  Driver &#34;intel&#34;
  Option &#34;AccelMethod&#34; &#34;exa&#34;
  Option &#34;MigrationHeuristic&#34; &#34;greedy&#34;
EndSection</pre></div>
<p>At least I think so&hellip; I did several reboots and restarted Xorg even
more times and saw no problems. Maybe the problem is completely fixed,
or it went back to appearing once a month. I prefer the former but
I can live with the latter. I&rsquo;m still not sure why moving to an SSD
would make all these problems appear. I gave the laptop to my
sister, let&rsquo;s see if she has anything to report after she uses it for a
while. In which case, I&rsquo;ll take another look when she visits again.</p>
