Hi! I'm George Vlahavas. I am a computer scientist, currently working as
a researcher in the Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki. My current research interests are focused on blockchain
technologies, but I have also been extensively involved with the areas
of Data Science and Statistics, with an application in various areas
such as Phonetics, Aquaculture, Food Science and Nutrition.

I have taught several classes of Applied Statistics and Biostatistics at
university level. I have even published a book on Applied Statistics.
Lately, I have also been involved with teaching Distributed Systems and
Operating Systems classes.

I have also been extensively involved in the Linux community for several
years. I am one of the founders and the project lead of
[Salix](https://www.salixos.org/), a GNU/Linux distribution focused on
simplicity, speed and ease of use, with stability being the primary
goal. I'm rather proud of what we have accomplished with Salix; it's a
nice feeling knowing that your software is being used by thousands of
people around the world daily.

I currently live in Thessaloniki, Greece. I spend most of my (limited)
free time reading books, coding and tinkering with stuff.

Oh, and I have no social media presence whatsoever. If you'd like to
contact me, you can send me an email at <george@vlahavas.com>.
