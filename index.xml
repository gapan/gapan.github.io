      <description>My sister has an HP laptop that she bought a few years ago. The exact model is the HP 14-r27n. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a powerhouse when she bought it and it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t now, but having installed Salix, in place of the Windows 8 that came with it, and which were almost never booted, it still gets the job done.
So, she called me a few days ago and told me that something was wrong with it; certain apps wouldn&amp;rsquo;t launch.</description>

      <description>I have fortune enabled on most of my systems, so whenever I log in, I get a quotation. Today, I got this one. Suffice to say, I found it really funny!
 A is for awk, which runs like a snail, and
B is for biff, which reads all your mail.
C is for cc, as hackers recall, while
D is for dd, the command that does all.
E is for emacs, which rebinds your keys, and</description>

      <title>Using Hugo with Github Pages</title>

      <description>So, I decided to start using Hugo as the platform for my website/blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into different options, including Jekyll and Hexo and in the end, Hugo is the one that made the most sense to me.
