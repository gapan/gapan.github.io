      <description>So, I decided to start using Hugo as the platform for my website/blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into different options, including Jekyll and Hexo and in the end, Hugo is the one that made the most sense to me.
I also wanted to use Github Pages with it, including using a custom domain and using HTTPS by default. Had I chosen Jekyll, integration with Github Pages would have been automatic. However, Github Pages do not directly support any other static website generator.</description>
